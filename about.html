              <h2>Difficulty of buying rings</h2>
              <p class="lead">The hard truth is that buying wedding rings in Singapore is tiresome despite all of the advancement Singapore has made. There are many pushy salesmen that do not care about you, retail shops have a high markup just to afford their rent and customers are  treated like a cow to be milked. This once-in-a-lifetime experience is then ruined for many people.</p>
              <p class="lead">What if we could digitalise the shop but maintain the personal touch?</p>
              <p class="lead">The Diamond Ateliers was born to solve this problem as the new kind of 21st-century wedding ring company. The Diamond Ateliers was founded by third generation manufacturers educated at the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). As a team of diamond experts, designers, jewellery makers and romantic idealists, we work with the guiding principle that the once-in-a-lifetime ring that you wear everyday should be meaningful.</p>
              <p class="lead">That is why we are on a mission to make custom, personalised proposal rings accessible and affordable to all. And we do this in a special way by connecting you directly with the manufacturer (us) offering you a direct route to manufacturing expertise and pricing.</p>
              <p class="lead">And the reason why we insist on having an appointment is that you are unique and we have to understand your needs and desires to create a perfect bespoke Diamond Ateliers Ring.</p>
              <p class="lead">The Diamond Ateliers also proudly exhibit at International Jewelry Shows such as the Hong Kong International Jewelry Fair, Baselworld and JCK.</p>

              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p class="lead">The Diamond Ateliers was founded with a rebellious millennial spirit and a lofty objective: to offer designer bespoke rings at a revolutionary price in the leanest possible way.</p>
              <p class="lead">Every idea starts with a problem. Ours was simple: Diamond rings are too expensive and the way consumers purchase has remained the same for too long. As a 3rd generation manufacturer, I have seen our retail clients make a 70-100% markup  on goods we have sold them. Some of friends have bought from retailers and they paid a price much higher than it can be. While it is a once-in-a-lifetime event and you can’t put a cost on love, what if there were options to reduce that cost?</p>
              <p class="lead">It turns out there was a simple explanation. The jewelry industry is held back by retailers that have to keep prices high to ensure that their retail cost, salespeople and marketing are covered. Those beautiful retail shops you see at Orchard Road are at least $50,000 a month! So how else can they cover the cost and make a profit without having a significant markup?</p>
              <p class="lead">We started Diamond Ateliers to create an alternative. We know there are already e-tailers, but this is what is different – it is the first business for consumers to have a direct connection to a world-class manufacturing business that has been supplying retailers globally for decades.</p>
              <p class="lead">By circumventing traditional channels, designing rings in-house with our world-class established manufacturing business, and engaging with customers directly at our home office in Orchard, we’re able to provide higher-quality, better-looking rings at a fraction of the market price. It is simply the leanest possible method. Furthermore, we go the extra mile by providing all clients with a value bundle filled with discounts that will help with your proposal and big day (worth $550).</p>
              <p class="lead">We believe that buying rings should be easy and fun. It should leave you happy and good-looking, with money in your pocket.
                We also believe that there is a better way to buy high-quality bespoke rings.
                There’s nothing complicated about it. Beautiful high-quality bespoke rings, greater value for consumers.</p>
